# /etc/chrony.conf — NTP server for the fake env (RHEL 9)
# Serves NTP to 10.90.0.0/24 and syncs with public sources (adjust as needed).
# Docs: RHEL 9 time synchronization (chrony) & chrony project examples.

# Use public pool or your organization's upstream NTP servers
pool pool.ntp.org iburst

# Allow NTP clients from the lab subnet
allow 10.90.0.0/24

# Optional: serve time even when offline (set a high stratum so clients prefer real sources when available)
local stratum 10

# Step the clock on large initial offsets
makestep 1.0 3

# Record the rate at which the system clock gains/loses time
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift

# Log measurements statistics (optional)
#logdir /var/log/chrony

# Bind to all interfaces (default). To pin, uncomment:
#bindaddress 10.90.0.2
